# Release helpers for Hawki

This directory contains a list of node scripts that help with releasing new versions of HAWKI.
The only purpose is to keep the workflow file: `.github/workflows/publish-version.yml` clean and easy to read.
Each script is called from the workflow file at the appropriate step in the release process.
