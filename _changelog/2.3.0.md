# v2.3.0

### What's New

- ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT** We made the `development` branch the new default branch. This does not affect your current setup, as
  `main` is still our release branch. But for new setups ensure you check out the `main` branch for production use
  (`git clone -b main https://github.com/hawk-digital-environments/HAWKI.git`). We updated our documentation to reflect
  this change.

### Quality of Live

- Automatic CacheBuster for static assets. Instead of manually setting the asset version (js/css) in the templates, we
  now use a more robust hash generation, based on the HAWKI version and file modification time. If you extend HAWKI and
  want to hook into this logic? Take a look at the `APP_CACHE_BUSTER` environment variable.
- Dependency updates to the latest versions.
- Improve the error output in the `ChainedAuthService`
- *(Docker)* Ensure that PHP allows uploads greater than 2MB.

### Bugfix

- Clean up the `Dot Env` section in the documentation to reflect the environment variables for the auth services and
  cache buster.
- Fix an issue in the LDAP config, where there were missing braces.
- Fixes an issue when using the external chat api without the "stream" property in the request.
- Fixes the `app:token` command to use the correct service.

### Internal Changes

- Adds a release workflow and a changelog to the [docs](https://docs.hawki.info/changelog)
- Inlines the documentation deployment pipeline into the HAWKI repository.
