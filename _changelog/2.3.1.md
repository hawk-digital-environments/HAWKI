# v2.3.1

### Quality of Life

- LDAP authentication - due to frequent support requests, we've improved error messages and logging for LDAP authentication issues.

### Bugfix

- Resolves an error occurring when executing `php artisan route:cache`, reading: `Unable to prepare route [req/login] for serialization` which was caused by two routes having the same name.
