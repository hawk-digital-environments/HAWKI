# v2.2.0

### What's New

- Custom Auth Services for your own needs; learn more in
  the [documentation](https://github.com/hawk-digital-environments/HAWKI/blob/development/_documentation/3-architecture/8.1-Custom%20Auth%20Services.md).

### Quality of Live

- We created an extensive documentation about the Auth
  configuration [here](https://github.com/hawk-digital-environments/HAWKI/blob/development/_documentation/5-Deployment/5-Authentication.md#openidconnect-oidc)
  to help you understand what to configure where.
- LDAP environment variables. Over the last couple of weeks we heard about a lot of confusion because of the naming of
  the LDAP variables `LDAP_BASE_DN`, in comparison with the `LDAP_SEARCH_DN` and were asked why there was no
  `LDAP_BIND_DN`. We heared you, and restructured the variable names to make more sense in common LDAP termini; we hope
  this helps. **fear not!** As this is a minor update we provide full backward compatibility until the next major
  version.

### Bugfix

- Auth Service cleanup - We did a lot of housekeeping tasks around the auth services (LDAP, Shibboleth and OIDC) to fix
  bugs but also allow a much cleaner flow.
- Updated docker service versions to the latest.

### Deprecation

- The Shibboleth and OIDC routes (`/req/login-shibboleth` and `/req/login-oidc`) have been marked as deprecated and have
  been replaced with the shared route `/req/login`. Ensure to update your setup according to
  our [documentation](https://github.com/hawk-digital-environments/HAWKI/blob/development/_documentation/5-Deployment/5-Authentication.md#openidconnect-oidc).
  **fear not!** As this is a minor update we provide full backward compatibility until the next major version.
