<p>Welcome to the guide for using :system, which provides language models from
OpenAI and open source models via GWDG.</p>

<p>This guide should provide all university members and university staff with
clear guidelines on how to use this technology responsibly. Please note that this guide supplements the OpenAI terms of use
and makes no claim to completeness. It is the responsibility of the users to
comply with the terms of use.</p>

<h3>General Provisions</h3>

<p><b>What is prohibited:</b></p>
<li>Input of personal data about yourself or others.</li>
<li>Use of services for illegal, harmful or abusive activities.</li>
<li>Violation, abuse or infringement of the rights of others.</li>
<li>Modification, copying, rental, sale or distribution of our services.</li>
<li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile or discover source code or underlying components.</li>
<li>Automatic or programmatic extraction of data or output.</li>
<li>Claiming that output was created by humans when it was not.</li>
<li>Impairment or disruption of services or circumvention of protective measures.</li>
<li>Use of output to develop competing models.</li>

<p><b>What to consider: </b></p>

<p>You are responsible for the input you provide and the resulting output. You must ensure that your input does not violate any rights and that you
have all necessary rights, licenses and permissions to provide the
input.</p>

<p><b>Accuracy: </b></p>

<p>Using the services may result in inaccurate or erroneous output. It is important that you critically review the output and do not use it as the sole
source of truth. Your inputs are not stored by HAWK, but by OpenAI for 30 days
to detect any misuse. After 30 days, the data is deleted. Your inputs are not used to make the product safer or better.
HAWK has a data processing agreement with GWDG, which stipulates
that GWDG does not store any data that is sent to
GWDG via HAWKI. An overview of the models provided by GWDG can be found
at: <a href="https://docs.hpc.gwdg.de/services/chat-ai/models/index.html"

<h3><b>Group Chat:</b></h3>

<p>The following basic rules apply in group chat for respectful interaction
with each other: </p>
<li>Treat other participants with respect and courtesy.</li>
<li>Constructive discussions are welcome, but personal attacks or offensive language should be avoided.</li>
<li>Stay on topic and avoid spam or excessive self-promotion.</li>
<li>Do not spread false or misleading information.</li>
<li>Be aware that all messages in group chat can be read and processed by group members.</li>
<li>The use of group chat should be oriented towards the general ethical and data protection guidelines of the university.</li>
<li>In case of abusive or discriminatory behavior, we reserve the right to exclude you from using HAWKI.</li>

<p>All content shared in group chat can be seen and processed by other participants. Be aware that no sensitive or personal data should be
shared in the chat.</p>

<h3>Specific Provisions</h3>

<p>For the use of generative AI systems, there is a preliminary guideline and
a declaration of independence.</p>

<p><b>For Students: </b></p>
<li>Use HAWKI to support your learning process, but do not rely exclusively on the generated answers.</li>
<li>Do not share personal data or information via HAWKI.</li>
<li>Also not the personal data of others.</li>
<li>You assume authorship.</li>
<li>Thus you guarantee the quality of the answer and assume responsibility for the content. The use of AI and the nature of its contribution should be clarified.</li>

<p><b>For Teachers: </b></p>
<li>HAWKI may not be used to correct student work if this work contains personal data that is extractable.</li>
<li>Use HAWKI as a supplementary tool for preparing teaching materials, but ensure that all content is checked for accuracy and relevance.</li>

<p><b>For Staff: </b></p>
<li>It is strictly forbidden to enter confidentiality agreements or internally determined documents into HAWKI.</li>
<li>Also no documents that contain personal data about yourself or others.</li>
<li>Use HAWKI to increase efficiency and support your daily tasks, but in compliance with the university's data protection guidelines and security regulations.</li>

<p>This guide serves as a guide for the responsible use of HAWKI. It is important that all users understand and
follow the stated provisions to ensure safe and ethical use of this technology.
The university can only offer this service if you do not enter personal
data.</p>

<p>If you have questions or uncertainties, please contact Prof. Stefan WÃ¶lwer, Arian Sadafi, Jonas Trippler or Vincent Timm. Notwithstanding this guide, the OpenAI terms of use apply.</p>
