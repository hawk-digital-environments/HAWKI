# Guidelines for Using HAWKI

Welcome to the guidelines for using HAWKI, which provides language models from OpenAI, Google, and open-source models via GWDG.  

These guidelines are intended to give all university members a clear framework for responsible use of this technology. Please note that these guidelines supplement, but do not replace, the terms of use of OpenAI and Google. Users remain responsible for complying with those terms.

## General Provisions

### Prohibited:
- Entering personal data about yourself or others.  
- Using the services for illegal, harmful, or abusive activities.  
- Violating, misusing, or infringing on the rights of others.  
- Modifying, copying, renting, selling, or distributing the services.  
- Attempting to reverse-engineer, decompile, or discover source code or underlying components.  
- Automatically or programmatically extracting data or outputs.  
- Claiming that output was created by humans when it was not.  
- Interfering with or disrupting services or circumventing protective measures.  
- Using output to develop competing models.  

### Important to note:
- You are responsible for both the input you provide and the resulting output.  
- Ensure your input does not infringe on any rights and that you hold the necessary permissions, rights, or licenses.  

### Accuracy:
- Use of these services may result in inaccurate or faulty output.  
- Always critically evaluate results and do not use them as the sole source of truth.  
- Your inputs are not stored by HAWK but are retained by OpenAI for 30 days for potential misuse detection. They are deleted afterwards.  
- Your inputs are not used to improve the product.  
- HAWK has a data processing agreement with GWDG, ensuring that GWDG does not store data sent via HAWKI.  
- A list of models provided by GWDG can be found here: [GWDG Models](https://docs.hpc.gwdg.de/services/chat-ai/models/index.html).

## Group Chat

Rules for respectful group interaction:

- Treat all participants with respect and courtesy.  
- Constructive discussions are encouraged, but personal attacks or offensive language must be avoided.  
- Stay on topic; avoid spam or excessive self-promotion.  
- Do not spread false or misleading information.  
- Be aware that all group chat messages can be read and processed by other members.  
- Use of the chat must comply with ethical and data protection standards of the university.  
- Abusive or discriminatory behavior may result in exclusion from HAWKI.  
- Do not share sensitive or personal data in chats.

## File Uploads

### Purpose:
File uploads allow temporary AI-supported processing of content.  

### Permissible content:
Only files that:  
- were created by the uploading user, or  
- have a legal basis for use in the university context (e.g., § 60a UrhG, excerpts from literature, own notes, presentations, etc.).  

The user is responsible for ensuring uploads do not violate copyright or personal rights.  

### Storage duration:
- Uploaded files are automatically deleted after six months at the latest, unless manually deleted earlier.  
- This follows the principle of data minimization under GDPR.  

### Data protection:
- Processing is solely for university-related purposes.  
- No data is shared with third parties.  
- Further details are available in the HAWKI privacy policy.

## Specific Provisions

- A preliminary guideline and declaration of independence exist for generative AI usage.  
- Students may use HAWKI for learning support but must not rely solely on generated responses.  
- Entering personal data (own or others’) is strictly prohibited.  
- Students remain responsible for outputs created with HAWKI and must disclose the use of AI transparently.  
- **Teachers:** Automated grading of exams, essays, reports, or similar is prohibited.  
- This ban follows the EU AI Act, which prohibits generative AI in high-risk educational assessments.  
- Allowed uses include spelling/grammar checking, feedback preparation, simplifying language, creating rubrics or teaching materials.  
- **University staff:** Uploading documents containing personal data or subject to confidentiality is prohibited.  
- HAWKI may be used for efficiency and daily work support, provided that data protection and security policies are followed.

## Final Notes

These guidelines are intended as orientation for the responsible use of HAWKI.  
The university can only provide this service if no personal data is entered.  

**Contact for questions:**  
Prof. Stefan Wölwer, Arian Sadafi, Jonas Trippler, or Vincent Timm.  

Regardless of these guidelines, the terms of OpenAI and Google apply.
